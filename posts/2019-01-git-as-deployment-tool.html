        This is the simplest way to setup a push-to-deploy system. You do not need any scripts, services or version control hosting to make it work. You just need to have ssh and git on your machine and server.
    </p>

    <p>
        Run these commands on your remote server, in the folder you wish to deploy:
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>
            git init --bare<br>
            git config receive.denycurrentbranch ignore<br>
            echo "git checkout -f" >> .git/hooks/post-receive<br>
            chmod +x .git/hooks/post-receive<br>
        </code>
    </p>

    <p>
        Now run this in your local repository:
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>
            git remote add server ssh://user@example.com/var/www/example.com<br>
            git push server master<br>
            git push --set-upstream server master<br>
        </code>
    </p>

    <p>
        That's it! Just push your changes to remote and they will be live. You can set any commands to be executed after deployments in .git/hooks/post-receive.
