    <h1>2020 Reading List</h1>

    <p>
        2020
    </p>

    <p>
        There are people who pride themselves in reading a book every week.
        However, I've looked at a few of those kinds of lists, and more often than not they are comprised of short, simple self-help books that mostly repeat the concepts you already know - literary equivalent of fast food. Nothing wrong with some fast food every now and then, but I wouldn't want that to be the basis of my diet.
    </p>

    <p>
        My unofficial goal for every year is to read 12 books.
        I don't really take it seriously and just read whatever I want whenever I want.
        Still, I'm happy to say that this is the first year I've reached and surpassed that goal - in the last few years I've been off by 1 or 2 titles.
        I think I'm getting better at picking the right books for myself.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you want to read more but are struggling, that's the only advice I can give - get better at finding the books you enjoy.
        Don't read what you're supposed to read; read what you want to read.
        Don't be afraid to stop reading something that feels like a slog 50 pages in; it's unlikely to get better.
        There are too many interesting books in the world to waste your time on boring ones.

        <strong>The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham.</strong>
        A treasured classic within value investing movement. Markets changed a lot since this book was written, so don't expect any practical tips. Read this as a history book instead, or artifact of an era. Comments at the end of each chapter give contemporary context, which helps immensely. I'm gonna be honest, there were a few chapters that I skipped entirely and went straight into comments, it was so frustrating. Still, if you're interested in value investing, why not start at the beginning? This one will not teach you what to do, but it will teach you how to think.

        <strong>On Writing by Stephen King.</strong>
        Quite personal and witty, it's much more an autobiography than an actual master class on writing. Not that I mind - I was much more interested in Stephen King himself than the lessons on the craft. While the tips seem useful and actionable, it's the honest and charming storytelling that made it a worthwhile read for me.

        <strong>The Dark Tower series (7 books) by Stephen King.</strong>
        The Dark Tower is a post-apocalyptic-fantasy-western series, which King himself considers his magnum opus. It also ties into many of his other stories. As a benefit of being long-running series, King doesn't have to rush through anything, so you get to spend a lot of time with the same characters. While slow and goofy at times, especially as it's mythology keeps piling on in the later books, it's still highly entertaining. By the end the characters and their journey feel as real as anything - you just can't get that level of impact from a single novel. The ending is supposed to be controversial, but to me it was perfect, and, more importantly, felt <em>right</em>.
        <br>
        It's worth mentioning that King's writing style itself is very compelling to me. The way he structures his sentences and paragraphs, his word choices, his transitions between different tones are just <em>yummy</em> to me. The guy could write a manual for microwave and I'd still enjoy reading it. Appreciating the craft behind writing contributed a lot to my enjoyment of the whole thing.
        <br>
        <em>"The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed".</em>
        That's a pretty badass line to open a book as far as I'm concerned. If it captures your imagination too, then you owe it to yourself to give the first book ("The Gunslinger") a try. It's also the shortest one in the series at merely ~300 pages, so not a huge commitment. The Dark Tower series is huge at 4000+ pages, 7 novels in the main storyline (not counting additional ones), so I was a bit hesitant to buy into it, but I'm glad I did.
        <br>
        P.S. bonus points to King for the goodest boy ever put on paper. He first appears in the third book though.

        <strong>Thinking, fast and slow by Daniel Kahneman.</strong>
        Daniel Kahneman has been awarded Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his work on behavioral economics.
        "Thinking, fast and slow" was an instant classic when it was published, and for a good reason.
        It has potential to change your world-view, and in that dimension can be compared with Sapiens.
        However, unlike Yuval Noah Harari, Daniel is not as great a communicator, so this book is much more academic and heavy on research, which make it less accessible.
        I've listened to the audiobook and my understanding suffered from that.
        I'll be getting a paper copy to read this revisit it the future.

       <strong>When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing by Daniel H. Pink</strong>
       I've made a mistake of taking this up right after I finished "Thinking, fast and slow".
       Initially they seemed distinct enough, but "When" really is a sort of subset of Daniel's work - it even is cited more than once.
       The upside is that "When" was much shorter and more accessible.
       If you're planning to read both, I recommend reading this one first.
       You'll actually get through it in a couple of days and it holds enough actionable advice to be worthwile.
       "Thinking, fast and slow" goes much more wider and deeper, but it will also take much more commitment to get through.

       <strong>Elements of Style (4th edition) by William Strunk Jr, E. B. White.</strong>
       Recommend by Stephen King himself, this is <em>the</em> American English style guide.
       The original from 1920 was 43 pages long; the latest edition from 1999 has "balooned" to 105, but is only better for it.
       The main feature of this booklet is how opionated and actionable it is.
       I'm even playing with the idea of making some kind of software tool to help internalize the rules.
       That's all to say I enjoyed the book and will be adding this to my permanent library to keep for future reference.

        <strong>Greenlights by Matthew McConaughey.</strong>
        This wasn't in my reading list.
        I was just browsing Audible, looking to spend my credits that have accumulated over a few months.
        This new release caught my eye.
        <br>
        I'm generally not a fan of biographies.
        My problem is that usually they concentrate too much on the specific person and not enough on the era and general context.
        By doing that it becomes a lazy rehash of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory">great man theory</a>, which I just do not believe.
        <br>
        This, hovever, is a memoir by one of the best voices in Hollywood, so I was willing to give it a pass.
        The recipe here is simple: a bunch of stories and insights of a well-known man told in chronological order.
        Matthew's life wasn't particularly full of hardship, but he doesn't try to pretend that.
        The story doesn't need life-or-death stakes to be interesting if one is a good storyteller - and Matthew definitely is.
        <br>
        In my experience, most books are better on paper (or Kindle) and make for <em>okay</em> audiobook experiences.
        This one is the exact opposite - it <em>only</em> makes sense as an audiobook.
        The stories told would lose half the charm if they were disconnected from the voice telling them.
        I couldn't care less for generic self-help advice or vague spirituality, but thankfully those were pretty short and easy to ignore. Makes for perfect before-the-bed listening, and doesn't try to be anything more than that.

        <strong>Absolute FreeBSD by Michael Lucas</strong>
        Easily the most technical book this year, and thus not exactly a page-turner.
        I've been interested in the BSD family of operating systems for a while now, and have toyed with them on a few different occasions.
        There's a lot of overlap with all *NUX family of operating systems, so it always felt familiar.
        However, this year I decided to put in some effort and get to know FreeBSD in a more structured way.
        I chose FreeBSD (as opposed to NetBSD or OpenBSD) since it's the most popular, well supported and rounded of the bunch - can perform just as well as webserver or desktop system.
        Did my research and this book came up as both informative and accessible.
        The author is a network and security engineering veteran, so definitely knows his stuff.
        I'm still reading it, but can already tell that it's a good book to keep around for reference in the future.
