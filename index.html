        This is my homebase. I develop full-stack web applications, work out, ride my bicycle and motorcycle, read books. Currently working as a tech lead at <a href="https://www.mailerlite.com/">MailerLite</a>. Sometimes I get the urge to write down what I know. You can find these posts below.

    <p>...or rather my abandonware.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/tadaspaplauskas/notes">Notes</a> (2019)</h3>
    <p>
        This started as a challenge to myself to make a full web application without any javascript - it was a success.
        It was pretty usable and had a straightforward feature list: mardown support, tags, file uploads, sharing.
        I eventually started using paper notebooks for daily notes and Workflowy for more structured information, so this became obsolete.
    </p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/tadaspaplauskas/scrapethat">Scrapethat.com</a> (2017-2019)</h3>
    <p>
        I made this one to scratch my own itch.
        The use-case was to scrape and parse classified advertisements websites into SQL database to run various queries against the data.

        I used it when I was looking for apartment or motorcycle to run analysis of specific year ranges, features, models, and such.
        Unfortunately it wasn't as useful as I expected to be.
    </p>

    <h3><a href="http://button.paplauskas.lt">Big Red Button</a> (2016)</h3>
    <p>
        A virtual big red button for party games. We used it for "guess the song" type of game and it was a lot of fun.
        Just a fun 1 hour project that I threw together on the last day of 2016. Powered by node.js, socket.io and a bit of jQuery. You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/tadaspaplauskas/big-red-button">Github.</a>
    </p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/tadaspaplauskas/trendingnow">trendingnow.io</a> (2016-2017)</h3>
    <p>
        Constantly scans twitter stream for huge trends and emails you if it finds something.  I cannot say that worked as reliable as I had hoped, but it was a cool proof of concept. No longer maintained.
    </p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/tadaspaplauskas/remindbot">remindbot.xyz</a> (2016-2017)</h3>
    <p>
        A facebook messenger chatbot. Your friend with a perfect memory. This bot allows you to set reminders using natural language. Started as a simple experiment it still got some attention without any promotion. No longer maintained and stopped working a while ago thanks to facebook constantly changing their APIs.
    </p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/tadaspaplauskas/pattern-parser">pattern-parser</a> (2016)</h3>
    <p>
        Node.js package that makes it easier to design and develop text-based user interfaces. Made it for my own project (remindbot), but <a href="https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=pattern-parser">a few hundred people</a> found it useful too.
    </p>

    <h3><a href="https://tadaspaplauskas.github.io/abtestinglab/">abtestinglab.com</a> (2015-2016)</h3>
    <p>
        A simple WYSIWYG A/B testing tool for content creators. It was a cool SaaS that unfortunately never really got off the ground. No longer maintained. I should probably rewrite it into an open-source package, as I still believe the tool had a few good ideas.
    </p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/tadaspaplauskas/apidocs">ApiDocs</a> (2015)</h3>
    <p>
        Laravel package that will automatically generate API endpoints documentation based on your documented routes.
    </p>

    <h3>Even older stuff</h3>
    <p>
        We don't talk about that here.
